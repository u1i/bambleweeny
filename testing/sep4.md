Years and months, different time zones, one missed call at a time.

I still taste the silence between your “hello” and mine, the way others taste wine.

You’re the only geography I never learned in school, yet every street I walk is towards you. I bring my AirPods like a kid saving candy, just in case the universe decides you're going to call.  

I used to say “I love you” because that’s what people do. Only now I know the weight of it.  

You are the quiet half-hour that makes the rest of the noise bearable. You are the reason even things like taking a shower turns into cinema, when I close my eyes and see your face like a watermark on steam.  

The world is on fire, clocks are liars, but every missed call is a proof that the flame will travel on forever.  

Keep dialing. I’ll keep picking up.
